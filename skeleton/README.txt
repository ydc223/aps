Sample Package Version: v1.0

After you unzip the problem package, you need to give the folder a proper name.

If this is the directory you obtain:

skeleton/data/...
        /gen/...
        /input_format_validators/...
        ...
             
You should call "verifyproblem skeleton" to verify the package.
Replace "skeleton" by your own problem id.
